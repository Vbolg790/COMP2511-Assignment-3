                        Throughout my time at the university, I have been able to engage in a diverse range of academic and extracurricular
                         activities, such as CAMRU and as of next year, robotics. This has not only increased my knowledge and skillset, but has also shaped me into the well-rounded individual that I am today. 
                         This was a great university to attend seeing as there are so many people like me with simular interest and goals. The curricumum is well made and 
                         very interesting to learn about.

                        During my time at MRU, I gained valuable experience in programming through labs, assignments and personal projects. 
                        I practiced my skills in various programming languages, including Java and Python, and developed a strong 
                        understanding of fundamental programming concepts such as data structures, algorithms, and software design patterns. 
                        Although coming with no background in programming, I am able to quickly pick up on complex concepts and apply them to my projects.

                        As a designer, I have gained extensive experience in creating visually appealing and functional designs for various 
                        mediums. I possess a strong understanding of design principles such as typography, color theory, and layout. I have experience
                         in designing for print, digital, and multimedia platforms, and am skilled in creating designs that are 
                         user-centered and align with brand guidelines. Having spent my entire life understanding art and visually appealing aspects of everyday things
                         makes me a rather well versed designer.
