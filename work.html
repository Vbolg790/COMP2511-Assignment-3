              <h3>How I got the job</h3>
              <p>
                I wasn't meant to have this job. One day my friend wanted to drop off her resume and I tagged along because it sounded fun. A few days later
                I get a call to come in for an interview. I had the interview with an amazing manager and she liked me. The've kept me ever since.

              <h3>The experiences that I gained</h3>
              <p>
                I've been able to do so many dun things at Party City. From helping out customers to helping out with the layout of the store and where products 
                should go. I'm one of the fastest people there when it comes to inflating balloons and although it's not the most practical skill to have, its fun
                to do and to impress people with,

              <h3>What I gained from Party City</h3>
              <p>
                I gained many new things from working at Party City. I met some of my greatest friends there. I learnt how to finally speak up and not be afraid of other people.
                Seeing as I started working there at age 15, I gained very good customer service experience. I also learnt to go after opportunities that are put in front of me.

              <h3>The team</h3>
              <p>
                As sappy as it may sound, i've met some of the best people through my job. I got to learn so many new things about really cool people, and I got to be a part of 
                what I consider as another family. Although people come and go, im so lucky to have know the Party City team, and am excited to see who else I get to meet.

              <h3>Scholarship</h3>
              <p>
                Seeing as I was enrolled in university, I was able to apply for a scholarship that was provided to me by our companies owner. A applied and submitted
                my answers to the required questions and surprisingly I was one of the 20 people across Canada who won the Canadian Tire Scholarship! To this day
                I'm still amazing that what I wrote regarding my experiences won me a scholarship.

              <h3>Things that will always stay with me</h3>
              <p>
                Something that will always stay with me is how to treat customers and the people around me. As long as you begin the day with a kind word 
                and help people in anyway you can, you're going to be (almost) always met with kindness back. Ill also always remember the balloon prices. I 
                could never forget the balloon prices, as shown below.
