            <h2>Party City</h2>
            <p>
                Working at Party City was an exciting and rewarding experience for me. As a sales associate,
                 I had the opportunity to work in a fast-paced and dynamic environment where customer service
                  was of the utmost importance. I enjoyed helping customers find the perfect party supplies 
                  and decorations for their events, and I took pride in ensuring that every customer left
                   the store satisfied with their purchases. In addition to sales, I also had the opportunity
                    to assist with visual merchandising and inventory management, which helped me develop a 
                    keen eye for detail and a strong understanding of the retail industry. I also appreciated
                     the opportunity to work with a diverse team of colleagues and managers, who were supportive
                      and collaborative, and helped me to develop my interpersonal and teamwork skills. 
                      Overall, my experience at Party City allowed me to develop a strong work ethic, customer
                       service skills, and retail industry knowledge that I will carry with me throughout my 
                       future career endeavors. Below is a table that summarizes just a couple of prices and information
                       we needed to know off the top of our head to engage in helping customers:

                  <tr>
                    <td>32 Inch</td>
                    <td>Foil</td>
